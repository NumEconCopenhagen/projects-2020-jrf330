Our project is titled Overlapping Generation Model with Pay-As-You-Go and is about solving and comparing a basic OLS model with one which includes social security in the form of PAYG.

The results of the project can be seen from running [OLG model with PAYG.ipynb].

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires numpy, optimize from scipy, sympy, and matplotlib.pyplot.
